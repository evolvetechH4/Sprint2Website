<p> Terms of service

Our definition of spam

    We view any unsolicited, unexpected email/SMS as spam.
    We don’t allow use of 3rd party lists, whether consent has been gathered or not. We don’t believe that consent is transferrable between organisations.
    We believe that any communications sent to a subscriber about an unrelated subject to that which they requested to be kept informed about are spam.

Sign-Up.to is registered under the Data Protection Act to handle personal data, and we are proactive in ensuring that personal data is kept safe.
Spam reports

If you have received a communication from a Sign-Up.to member and are unsure of why you have received it please forward the email, or contents of the text message to: abuse.reports@sign-up.to and we will look into the matter and contact you to resolve the issue.
Privacy policy

We take the privacy of client and end user data very seriously. The entire Sign-Up.to system is designed to provide all parties with complete control over their data.

We believe that your personal data is your own, and you should control it. Because of this Sign-Up.to do not rent, sell or otherwise disclose data to 3rd parties unless we are required to by law.

That’s the short version. Because our lawyers like to earn their fees, they insisted that we also have the long version below…

Sign-Up Technologies Limited (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “SuTL”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we use the information we collect about you through Sign-UpT, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.

Terms of service

These terms relate to use of the Sign-Up.to web application and related services. For terms relating to general use of our website please click here.

We like to keep things straight forward, so before we get to the legal stuff our lawyers say we have to have, here’s a plain english breakdown of the key things you need to know when using Sign-Up.to:

    Your data remains yours at all times. We’ll never disclose your data to third parties unless required by law or requested by you.
    Unless otherwise arranged, we bill monthly based on the maximum number of active subscribers in your account during the previous month. Payments are collected by credit/debit card on the day of issue. Failure to pay on time will result in suspension of access until your invoice is paid.
    We provide free phone and email support during UK working days, from 9am – 5.30pm.
    Managed services (such as alterations to or creation of email campaigns or use of the service on your behalf) are subject to additional charges which will be agreed with you before the work is undertaken.
    We take permission very seriously. Sign-Up.to may only be used for permission-based data, without exception. Use of a purchased list or addresses obtained without permission will result in immediate termination of your account, without refund. We check all data uploaded to Sign-Up.to.
    We will not tolerate the sending of Spam messages. Spam is best defined by the recipient. If your complaint rate is excessive (as determined solely by Sign-Up.to) or in any case if your spam complaint rate (readers hitting the ‘this is spam’ button with their ISP) exceeds 0.3% this is grounds for immediate termination without refund.
    If you wish to cancel your account you can do so at any time with 30 days notice. Cancellations can only be made by sending an email to cancel@sign-up.to from the email address of the account administrator, for your security we will not accept verbal cancellation instructions. Cancellation will not be finalised until all outstanding invoices are paid. For annual contracts the full balance of the remaining contract period must be paid prior to cancellation.

4.6 The Client shall take account of and promptly comply with all reasonable directions of SuTL in relation to its use of the Services.

5. CHARGES AND PAYMENT

5.1 Where the client chooses to pay monthly or has overage charges due, SuTL will invoice the Charges each month on the Payment Day for the month concerned. The invoice shall be sent to the Client by email, detailing the minimum payment in advance for the following month and any payments due over the minimum payment for the previous month. Annual payments will be invoiced by email on the anniversary of the agreement date as detailed on the Service Order Agreement.

5.2 All charges quoted to the Client shall be exclusive of VAT which SuTL shall add to its invoices at the appropriate rate;

5.3 The Client shall pay each invoice submitted to it by SuTL, in full and in cleared funds, on the date of each invoice.

5.9 SuTL may, at it’s sole discretion, request a further pre-payment for services if the Client uploads data or sends emails in excess of their previously pre-paid allowance. Until such payment is made, further message delivery may be temporarily suspended.
6. DATA, DATA PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY

6.1 It is a condition of this agreement that the Client complies with all applicable Data Protection Legislation (including, if located in the European Economic Area “EEA”, any locally applicable legislation giving effect to EC Directive 95/46/EC, such as the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 or official guidance).

7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

7.1 As between the Client and SuTL, all Intellectual Property Rights and all other rights in the Site and the pre-existing Materials (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes the Trade Mark) shall be owned by SuTL. Subject to condition 7.2, SuTL licenses all such rights as are necessary to use the Software and Trade Mark to the Client on a non-exclusive, worldwide basis to such extent as is necessary to enable the Client to make reasonable use of the Services. If this Agreement is terminated, this licence will automatically terminate.

7.2 The Client acknowledges that, where SuTL does not own any pre-existing Materials, the Client’s use of rights in pre-existing Materials is conditional on SuTL obtaining a written licence (or sub-licence) from the relevant licensor or licensors on such terms as will entitle SuTL to license such rights to the Client. Use of the Software is on the following terms:

(b) the Client shall have no right to copy, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or modify the Software in whole or part except as permitted by law;

7.3 The Client undertakes not to do or permit to be done any act which would or might jeopardise or invalidate any registration of the Intellectual Property Rights, or application for registration, nor to do any act which might assist or give rise to an application to remove any of the Intellectual Property from an official register or which might prejudice the right or title of SuTL to the Intellectual Property.

7.4 The Client will not make any representation or do any act which may be taken to indicate that it has any right title or interest in or to the ownership or use of any of the Intellectual Property Rights except under the terms of this Agreement, and acknowledges that nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the Client any right, title or interest in or to the Intellectual Property save as granted hereby.

7.5 All use of the Intellectual Property rights (including the Trade Mark) by the Client shall be for the benefit of SuTL and the goodwill accrued to the Client arising from its use of the Intellectual Property (including the Trade Mark) (but no greater or other goodwill) shall accrue to and be held in trust by the Client for SuTL which goodwill the Client agrees to assign to SuTL at its request and own cost at any time, whether during or after the term of this Agreement.

7.6 The Client shall direct any commercial enquiries in relation to the sign-up.toTM Services to SuTL.

The Client shall be responsible for ensuring that all other requirements relating to labelling, packaging, advertising, marketing and other such matters are complied with. The use of the Trade Mark by the Client shall at all times be in keeping with and seek to maintain its distinctiveness and reputation as determined by SuTL and the Client shall cease any use to the contrary as SuTL may require.
