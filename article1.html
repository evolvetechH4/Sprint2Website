Everyone knows Eden Hazard is pretty near unstoppable 
when he gets on the ball, but stats show Chelsea forward is 
even better than Barcelona duo lionel Messi and Neymar in 
that department.</b>

<pre style="text-align:center;">
After some patchy form last season, Hazard is back to his best again this term, and stats from the 
start of 2014/15 show he’s technically the best dribbler on the planet.

<img src="article1_1.jpg" width="548" height="392">
According to Squawka, the 26-year-old has completed more take-ons than any other player in that period,
with 388. 

Neymar is just behind him on 366, with Messi just three off his team-mate with 363 in third place. 
Surprisingly, Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha is fourth with 311 in that time.

Hazard’s superb recent form has seen him linked with Real Madrid, and numbers like this show why. Still, Chelsea fans
will be pleased by reports that he’s keen to stay at Stamford Bridge out of loyalty to manager Antonio Conte, and may even 
sign a new contract soon.
